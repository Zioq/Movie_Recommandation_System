* About the appliction 

This application use React for `front-end`, Node Express for `Back-end` and MongoDB for `Database`.
Also, use the MovieAPI to get the movie information.
Especially, for database, I used MongoDB Cloud service. So, if you want to check/test the data is saved DB, you have to change `mongoURI` which is located in the server>config>dev.js
